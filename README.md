How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with a system analysis and collecting feedback from the user and team members about the program. Having a meeting with the client will also help with determining the needs of the user. Utilizing user stories helps with interpreting user needs as it allows the scrum team to gather information that can be overlooked from the clients as they discussing their wants and needs of the expectations of the program. Its helps the teams to understand the users perspective.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs begins with understanding the expecations the client has for the program. Dependent on each project, delveoping a program can be approached in several different ways dependong on the needs of the client. I plan on using user stories in the future as they provide the most insight on the wants and needs of the client and can be easily updated to reflect any changes the client may have at any point during development. I also will plan on relying on daily scrum meetings to discuss the work that has been completed, what issues I may and how those can be solved with my team.
